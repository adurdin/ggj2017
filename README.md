# FRACK the PLANET

A game made for Global Game Jam 2017.

# YOUR ORDERS

You! Take this Fractor-Driller and drive around this planet [← →]. Scan for
valuable deposits underground with the GeoSonar [space]. They're worth money--
the bigger the better! When you've found one, stick that drill into it [↓ ↑]
and get pumping [space]! Don't stop pumping even for an instant or you'll have
to start again [hold space]--we don't get paid unless every last atom of the
gas in a deposit is pumped out! Oh, and try to avoid running over those pesky
protestors--those lawsuits are expensive! Well, what are you waiting for? Our
competitors will be here in a minute! There's no time to waste! Get fracking!
